This is just a barebones readme for now. These are plain old python files. They can be run with the python command. They take command line arguments, call them with "--help" or "-h" for more info.

Note: These files were written and created by me. If you use them for a school lab or project, your teacher might care. If you have been assigned the same project, DO NOT READ THESE FILES until you have completed the project.
